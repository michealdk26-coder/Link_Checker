# ⚡ SETUP MONGODB NOW - Step by Step

## I've opened MongoDB Atlas in your browser. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Sign Up (30 seconds)
- Click "Sign up with Google" (fastest) OR
- Enter email and create password
- Click "Create your Atlas account"

### Step 2: Create FREE Cluster (Automatic - 2 minutes)
After signup, you'll see a page:
1. ✅ Select: **M0 FREE** (should be pre-selected)
2. ✅ Provider: **AWS** or **Google Cloud**
3. ✅ Region: Choose one close to you (e.g., US East, EU, Asia)
4. ✅ Cluster Name: Keep default `Cluster0`
5. ✅ Click **"Create Deployment"** (green button)

**IMPORTANT:** A popup will show your credentials:
- 📝 Username: ______________ (COPY THIS!)
- 📝 Password: ______________ (COPY THIS!)
- Click "Create Database User"

### Step 3: Setup Network Access
You'll see "Where would you like to connect from?"
- Click "My Local Environment"
- Click "Add My Current IP Address"
- Then click "Add Entry" or "Confirm"

### Step 4: Get Connection String
1. Click "Connect" button
2. Choose "Drivers"
3. Select "Node.js" and latest version
4. Copy the connection string (looks like):
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

### Step 5: Update Your .env File
**I'll help you - just paste your connection string here:**

Replace in: `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Securelink\.env`

Current line:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/securelink
```

New line (replace <username> and <password> with YOUR details):
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/securelink?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Example:**
If username is `myuser` and password is `mypass123`:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://myuser:mypass123@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/securelink?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## After You Get Your Connection String:

**PASTE IT HERE and I'll update the .env file for you!**

Or you can:
1. Open: `C:\Users\HomePC\Desktop\Securelink\.env`
2. Replace the MONGODB_URI line
3. Save the file

Then I'll restart the server and your signup will work! ✅
